# Recommendation System

This repository contains experiments related to building recommendation systems. It explores different approaches for predicting user preferences and ranking items accordingly.

Currently, the notebook `popularity_based_ranking_and_SVD.ipynb` implements a simple popularity-based recommender and uses the `Surprise` libraryâ€™s `SVD()` model for collaborative filtering.
